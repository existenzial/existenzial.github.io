I’m always looking for an edge in my design projects. I am amazed at what is already readily available to utilize courtesy of the open source community. There are a wealth of JS libraries out there to give you some ideas of what’s possible and any gaps unaccounted for can be filled by instantiating your own idea and adding it for use on the public domain. I consider this fact alone another important reason to always pay your code forward to lend to future re-imaginings and possible collaborations with other people in the community. Check out some of the links below, fork and star the ones of interest on Git and get the creative juices flowing if they can be integrated with any of your current or future projects.

*Rainy Day JS – a simple JS application with gorgeously rendered effects
*Textures JS – adds that extra bit of flair to any custom graphics or interfaces
*Easel JS – lends creative templates for shapes, animations and games
*Bespoke JS – presents an elegant and simplified way to create customized presentations
*Hammer JS – allows you to add touch event functionality to your websites
*DataMaps JS – for stats/cartography geeks like me
Of course the aforementioned are only a drop in the bucket, so feel free to leave a comment suggesting any others that I’ve missed.
