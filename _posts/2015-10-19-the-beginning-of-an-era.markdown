>A lesson learned in remembering to breathe. A firehose of information shoots recursive blasts without base cases at my face, and I am reminded to leave a note for my future self:  “A month ago you didn’t even know how to write a simple for loop, and now look at how far you’ve come.”

As the end of week 2 of my time at Telegraph Academy comes to a close, I find myself filled with gratitude. I am thankful for the opportunity to continue to pursue the technical training necessary to emerge a competitive force in the ever-changing job market and thankful to be surrounded by individuals who will stop at nothing to make that possible. Under their empathic tutelage I can see my knowledge transforming into applicable methodology. The road ahead will be incredible. I can’t wait to see what they throw at us next.
